# Quizzical Trivia App

#### Quizzical is a Trivia App that fetches data from the Open Trivia DB API and displays the questions as a quiz for the user to test their general knowledge.

#### It is one of my first projects I took on to practice the new React concepts Ive been learning, which include:

- React.useState
- React props
- React.useEffect
- Components
- Conditional Rendering
### Demo:

### Features I plan to add:
- Allow user to choose questions category
- Allow user to choose questions difficulty
- Save user high score
